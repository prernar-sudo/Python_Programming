nmupy-----numerical python 
# NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library used for working with:
# Arrays (like mathematical vectors and matrices)
# Linear algebra
# Statistical calculations
# Machine learning and scientific computing
# It introduces a new type of data structure:
    -->ndarray (N-dimensional array) — a grid of values, all of the same type.
# numpy is used for high computation
# array works on n dimensionality, multidimension
# numpy is faster than list

pandas-----------Python Data Analysis Library
It’s built on top of NumPy and is used for:
Working with tabular data (like Excel sheets, CSVs, SQL tables)
Cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing data efficiently
It introduces two main data structures:

Series – 1D labeled array (like one Excel column)

DataFrame – 2D labeled data table (like an entire Excel sheet)

# pandas used for data transformation and manipulation
# in pandas -> we treat outlier value and then transform the data
# matplotlib -> used for data visualization
# seaborn -> for high end visualization , we use seaborn

# EDA -> exploratory data anlysis
# insights -> 5 data insights we have
# pillars of eda
# comparative analysis
# compositional analysis
# geographical  analysis
# time series analysis 
# statistical modelling ------> descriptive analysis
# on the basis of normal distribution we can make accurate prediction

# Function dependencies
* with argument with return type
* with argument without return type
* without argument with return type
* without argument without return type

# array that works in multi-dimensional thread
# conversion of multi directional array in singular dimension


# curve -kde ---> kernel density -> to remove curve 
# problem statement, dataset, task , data insights, conclusion
